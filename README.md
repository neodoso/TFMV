Team Fortress 2 Model Viewer

User Guide / More information: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=158547475

TFMV is a program that adds functionality and automation to the Source Engine HLMV.exe model viewer (of Team Fortress 2).

TFMV (Team Fortress Model Viewer) is a tool for Windows that makes it easier to load and preview TF2 player item loadouts in the model viewer "HLMV" 
and also helps for testing and developing workshop items by automating file loading and adding features on top of HLMV for tasks which are otherwise 
impossible or require tedious manual file managing and editing.

The tool also lists the TF2 items so you can easily pick and load items by their icon instead of having to search and pick the models by file name.
TFMV downloads the items list and icons from the official servers, so it's always up to date and the latest items can be loaded.

TFMV manages the models and materials(aka skins) of each item through a visual interface, rather than having search, load or edit files and dependencies manually.
It also makes it possible to switch skins(red/blue) on model attachments, change paint colors, easily edit skins with the material editor and test material 
changes in real time, take screenshots with specific resolutions, take screenshots with transparency, automatically capture screenshots for each of item's paint color, 
load workshop .zip compiled items, etc
